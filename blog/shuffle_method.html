<p>If you ever want to try to understand, or at least really appreciate what goes in to Ruby's beautiful built-in methods, try writing your own! Today I attempted to write a custom shuffle method in Ruby. While I certainly cannot guarantee this is how .shuffle() actually works, it gets the job done. </p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind when I think of shuffling a collection of information, is "random." We're taking a set of data, whether it's numbers, names, etc., and rearraging the items in the set in RANDOM order. Utilizing Ruby's rand() method will be really important to us in this sense. To start, I create a method called "shuffle," which takes an array. Since I have a feeling that random numbers are going to come into play for the method, I initialize an empty array called random_nums, as seen below. </p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/a94e9c3ce8abdd684fdf40d46485e6a7.js"></script>
<p>
<p>Think about shuffling an array as taking all of its elements and putting them in random positions in a new array. Therefore, the random numbers that we're about to generate could be considered the NEW INDICES that the original elements of our array will get in a NEW ARRAY.  </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/58be0baf246ff78743a1074abc33c31a.js"></script>

<p>Here, I've defined an empty string, called "numeral," where the Roman numeral I'm building will live. But that's not quite enough. If that's all I write, I'll get a crazy-looking Roman numeral; I'll have notation for how many times that respective key goes into my value, and the next key, however many times THAT key goes into my value, and then next key, however many times THAT key goes into the value, and so on. Yikes.</p>

<p>After the first set of Roman numerals have been added to my "numeral" string, I need to take "num" and decrement it by however much was just represented in the Roman numerals I added to "numeral." In other words, if my Arabic number is 204, and I've added "CC" to numeral for 200, I need to subtract that amount and move on to working with the leftover 4. The result is:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/d31f01d167e8c67694d64504296ecc85.js"></script>

<p> Now, when I pass in the argument of 204, I get "CCIIII."  That is a Roman numeral, but it's an old one. I'd like to be able to output CCIV, which utilizes the subtractive notation I was telling you about earlier. So what to do? I'll make a $modern_letters hash like so:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/d9ff22c39e33579a186f3cea8ad9395a.js"></script>

<p>Since the subtractive notation really only affects instances of 9, 4, 90, 40, 900, and 400 (after 3000, modern Roman numerals require a horizontal line above them to indicate multiples of 1,000, which I won't be covering in this challenge), those are the numbers I'll need to target. My keys are instances where I would have 4 "I's" in a row for 4, a "VIIII" instad of a 9, and so on, with their proper replacements based on subtractive notation. Also, it's important to put the VIIII and LXXXX before IIII and XXXX in the hash, since when we iterate over those, it could see the "IIII" first, when what actually needs to be changed in our number is "VIIII." </p>

<p>I also need a way to signal that I want to "modernize" the output of my original enumerable. I'll need to pass this in as an argument. If the argument is true, I'll have an if statement that iterates over my $modern_letters hash, and replaces patterns of old Roman numerals if it sees any. My code now looks like this: </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/5e1219fba6b976ad7c7a831ce47ae09e.js"></script>

<p>I give my method an empty object when I define it, and pass in :modern with a value of "true," since I want the modern version of my Roman numerals. In my second "if" statement, I check to see if my hash has the key :modern, and if it's true, iterate over $modern_letters and swap out any of the old notation for the new (using numeral.sub!)</p>

<p>Now, when I pass in 204, my Roman numeral is "CCIV." Awesome! But it's not awesome enough.</p>

<p>I'd really like to let a user input an integer to convert to a Roman numeral, just to make this a bit more interactive. This only takes a few small changes here and there. I'll need some gets methods, and just one more if statement. Here's what I've got:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/ea08568c1b11c6e74c00120476604743.js"></script>

<p>I take out my arguments, since those will be passed in as user input after the method gets called. My "gets" take in an integer, and a "Y", "N", or whatever the user chooses to enter. Based on what they choose to enter, I add :modern and set it to either true or false in my options hash, which will determine whether or not to run my each iterator and replace the old Roman numerals with the new ones. So, all together, I've got:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/a26121370d8773b9ff38403dbaf21817.js"></script>
<p>Pretty neat!</p>
