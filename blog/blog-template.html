<!--REFLECTIONS
It was a lot more interesting to wireframe with a pair than I thought it would be! It was a really interesting process, in that one of us would introduce an idea as to where an element could go, and the other would be able to point out issues that may cause, or have a better solution. In the end, I think we came up with something that I like better than what I would have created on my own!

Yes, wireframing was really helpful to my development process. Usually I jump into a project without too much planning, but that has caused some issues for me (both technical and stylistic) in the past. I feel much more confident about taking this project further with a solid plan now.

We focused on creating a clear hierarchy of information, trying to include a wide range of elements, and including things that would help UX (making sure to include "back" buttons at both the top and bottom of the page.) We also decided it would be helpful to include the HTML tags we would use for each element in our wireframe.

I learned about sections and asides! I felt very comfortable with HTML before this challenge, but I didn't know about those. I also liked reading the HTML specs on the Mozilla site. I thought they were pretty interesting, and I hadn't considered how much thought went into these tags!
