<p>So it turns out, there's more than one way to write a number in Roman numerals. Are you surprised to learn that in ancient Rome, the use of Roman numerals was somewhat varied and inconsistent (can you smell my sarcasm?) In any case, today I learned that there was a version of Roman numerals that was used widely in inscriptions and official texts that did not make use of the subtractive notation we associate with Roman numerals today (IV for 4, IX for 9, etc.) I wrote a little program that takes in an Arabic number, given by a user, and returns the Roman numeral for that number, based on your choice of old Roman numerals, or modern Roman numerals that make use of subtractive notation.   </p>

<p>To start, I made a hash of the base values that correspond to Roman numerals, and their associated notation. I also set up a method, convert_to_roman, that will take in an Arabic number</p>
<code data-gist-id="141a2b29f099b28faab3e841049a77a2"></code>

<p>Next, I'll need to write a method that, given a number, goes through this hash and determines which notations to use, and how many. If the number passed in is 200, let's say, I know that my Roman numeral should be "CC." If I'm passing in 3,000, my output should be "MMM." The trick here is figuring out how many times one of the keys in my hash $letters goes in to the number I'm passing in. However many times that is, is how many of those corresponding values ("M", "D", "X", etc.) I'll need. So I'll start with:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/58be0baf246ff78743a1074abc33c31a.js"></script>

<p>Here, I've defined an empty string, called "numeral," where the Roman numeral I'm building will live. But that's not quite enough. If that's all I write, I'll get a crazy-looking Roman numeral; I'll have notation for how many times that respective key goes into my value, and the next key, however many times THAT key goes into my value, and then next key, however many times THAT key goes into the value, and so on. Yikes.</p>

<p>After the first set of Roman numerals have been added to my "numeral" string, I need to take "num" and decrement it by however much was just represented in the Roman numerals I added to "numeral." In other words, if my Arabic number is 204, and I've added "CC" to numeral for 200, I need to subtract that amount and move on to working with the leftover 4. The result is:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/d31f01d167e8c67694d64504296ecc85.js"></script>

<p> Now, when I pass in the argument of 204, I get "CCIIII."  That is a Roman numeral, but it's an old one. I'd like to be able to output CCIV, which utilizes the subtractive notation I was telling you about earlier. So what to do? I'll make a $modern_letters hash like so:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/d9ff22c39e33579a186f3cea8ad9395a.js"></script>

<p>Since the subtractive notation really only affects instances of 9, 4, 90, 40, 900, and 400 (after 3000, modern Roman numerals require a horizontal line above them to indicate multiples of 1,000, which I won't be covering in this challenge), those are the numbers I'll need to target. My keys are instances where I would have 4 "I's" in a row for 4, a "VIIII" instad of a 9, and so on, with their proper replacements based on subtractive notation. Also, it's important to put the VIIII and LXXXX before IIII and XXXX in the hash, since when we iterate over those, it could see the "IIII" first, when what actually needs to be changed in our number is "VIIII." </p>

<p>I also need a way to signal that I want to "modernize" the output of my original enumerable. I'll need to pass this in as an argument. If the argument is true, I'll have an if statement that iterates over my $modern_letters hash, and replaces patterns of old Roman numerals if it sees any. My code now looks like this: </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/5e1219fba6b976ad7c7a831ce47ae09e.js"></script>

<p>I give my method an empty object when I define it, and pass in :modern with a value of "true," since I want the modern version of my Roman numerals. In my second "if" statement, I check to see if my hash has the key :modern, and if it's true, iterate over $modern_letters and swap out any of the old notation for the new (using numeral.sub!)</p>

<p>Now, when I pass in 204, my Roman numeral is "CCIV." Awesome! But it's not awesome enough.</p>

<p>I'd really like to let a user input an integer to convert to a Roman numeral, just to make this a bit more interactive. This only takes a few small changes here and there. I'll need some gets methods, and just one more if statement. Here's what I've got:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/ea08568c1b11c6e74c00120476604743.js"></script>

<p>I take out my arguments, since those will be passed in as user input after the method gets called. My "gets" take in an integer, and a "Y", "N", or whatever the user chooses to enter. Based on what they choose to enter, I add :modern and set it to either true or false in my options hash, which will determine whether or not to run my each iterator and replace the old Roman numerals with the new ones. So, all together, I've got:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/LisaBee224/a26121370d8773b9ff38403dbaf21817.js"></script>
<p>Pretty neat!</p>
