<p>What's a Ruby class? Besides being one of my favorite things about Ruby, classes are a way to churn out many objects with basically the same behavior, characteristics, and functionality. It's a way to keep parts of your code nicely bundled and organized, and to define custom behavior for your objects. To illustrate how classes work, let's take a zoo. </p>

<p>A zoo needs animals, so I'll start by making an Animal class. This class will encapsulate all of the information relating to my animals. In Ruby, classes are named with a constant (denoted by a capital letter), meaning we won't expect that name to change at all.</p>
<div class="pre"><pre>class Zoo<br><br><br>end</pre></div>
<p>What are the common traits that the animals in my zoo will have? They'll each be a certain species, have a name, be of a certain age, and have a favorite food. Whenever I add a new animal to my zoo, I'll need to record this information.<br>
To create a new instance of an object in a class, we always use the <b>initialize</b> method. All of our traits as described above will get passed into this method as arguments and assigned to <b>instance variables</b>. We'll talk more about instance methods soon. This is what my <b>initialize</b> method looks like now:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre>def initialize(species, name, age, favoritefood)<br> @species = species<br> @name = name<br>@age = age<br>@favoritefood = favoritefood<br>end</pre></div>
<p>So whenever I want to add a new animal, I need to call .new, which will trigger the initialize method and record all the information I pass into it. That will then get stored in the variable "animal." Here's how I do that:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre>animal = Animal.new("penguin," "Mr. Belvedere", 4, "sardines")<br>
</pre></div>

<p>I can then check this information by calling the .inspect method, which is a built-in object method. When I call <b>p animal.inspect</b> though, the output isn't very friendly-looking. I get: </p>
<div class = "pre"><pre>@species=\"penguin\", @name=\"Mr. Belvedere\", @age=4, @favorite_food=\"sardines\">"</pre></div>
<p>Woof! Let's try making this a little nicer. I'm going to re-write the inspect method so it will  output our information a little more nicely.</p>
You could also just overwrite the .inspect method, if you'd like.

<p>Here, I'm going to use string interpolation just to format our output in a more readable format.</p>
<div class = "pre"><pre>def inspect <br>
<br>
 "Our #{@species} is named #{@name}. They are #{@age} years old and love #{@favorite_food}."
<br>
end</pre></div>
<p>Now my output will be:</p>
<div class = "pre"><pre>def spect <br>
<br>
 "Our penguin is named Mr. Belvedere. They are 4 years old and love sardines."
<br>
end</pre></div>
<p>In this example, I used the instance variables that are in our class to output this description. So what are instance variables?</p>
<p>An <b>instance variable</b> is assigned to every new instance of a class. Every time a new animal is created, its traits will be stored in a new copy of our instance variables. Instance variables are only accessible within a class -- they are not public.</p>

<p>So I've created a penguin, and have defined a method for my class Animal, but let's say I want to make more animals. I can easily pass in some new arguments to the above method to create a new animal-- but where would my penguin go?</p>

<p>I need a place to store my animals (an array sounds as good an option as any), so I'm going to create a Zoo class, and initialize it with an empty array, to which I'll push my animals once I've created them:
<div class = "pre"><pre>class Zoo <br>
<br>
attr_reader :animals<br>
def initialize<br>
@animals = []<br>
end
</pre></div>
<p>All of this looks pretty similar to our Animal class, but what's the attr_reader :animals for? Later on in this class, I'm going to be outputting all the animals in my @animals instance variable, right? The method for that would look pretty basic:</p>
  <div class = "pre"><pre>def animals
<br>
@animals<br>
end
</pre></div>
<p>Instead of writing a method that just outputs information, I can use an <b>accessor</b>. @animals is a <b>readable</b> object in our class, so I can use the <b>attr_reader</b> method to signal that all I want the @animals instance variable to do is read me back the information it contains. Attribute accessors like this one are a great shortcut and will make your code more readable and organized.</p>

<p>So in my Zoo class, I need to write a method that will add every NEW animal I create (through the Animals class) to my @animals array. </p>
  <div class = "pre"><pre>def add_animal(species, name, age, favorite_food)
<br>
@animals << Animal.new(species, name, age, favorite_food)<br>
end
</pre></div>
  <p> Note here than I'm passing species, name, age, and favorite_food as arguments to my method, since those will exist as variables within this method once the new animal is pushed to my @animals array. Otherwise, add_animal has no idea what this information that's being passed in is for. </p>
  <p> The shovel operator << takes my new instance of an Animal, along with it's information, and pushes it into the @animals array. So now, whenever I create a new animal, I'll actually be doing it THROUGH the Zoo class. </p>
  <p>Now I can create as many animals as I want and add them to my zoo automatically by calling
  <div class = "pre"><pre>zoo = Zoo.new<br>
    zoo.add_animal("penguin", "Mr. Belvedere", 4, "sardines",)<br>zoo.add_animal("lion", "Ziggy", 6, "beef")<br>
    zoo.add_animal("hippo", "Paunchy", 9, "sushi")<br>
    zoo.add_animal("zebra", "Simon", 4, "grass")<br>
    zoo.add_animal("elephant", "Hephastus", 12, "bananas")
</pre></div>
<p> To look at all the animals in my zoo, I just call <b> p zoo</b>, and, sure enough, I get:</p>
 <div class = "pre"><pre>
  [Our penguin is named Mr. Belvedere. They are 4 years old and love sardines., Our hippo is named Pontius. They are 9 years old and love sushi., Our lion is named Ziggy. They are 6 years old and love beef., Our zebra is named Simon. They are 4 years old and love grass., Our elephant is named Hephastus. They are 12 years old and love banans.]</pre></div>
  <p>How cool is that?</p>
